# Neon Modal and Dark Mode Effects

This project demonstrates a neon-themed modal window with animation, dark mode toggle, and a matrix rain effect. The page includes interactive buttons, modal windows with fade-in/fade-out transitions, and a scrolling effect to fade in elements as the user scrolls down.

- **Matrix Rain Effect:**
  - A "Matrix" style rain of characters falls over the page for a futuristic look.

- **Scroll Fade:**
  - Elements fade in as they scroll into view.

## Technologies Used
